## Features of SWL-Callouts

### Overview 
* This plugin brings a wide range of callouts with similar real life situations.<br>
* A large majority of calls have a witness or suspect, which you need to speak with (dialogue included).<br>
* Every callout has different endings and possibilities for more variety realism.<br>
* Within this pack we have a whopping <b><u>56 varied and realistic police callouts</u></b> for LSPDFR. (Have a look below for a full list of all available callouts.)<br>
* A lot of callouts have different vehicles and weapons to have more realism.<br>
* All callouts have several locations in order to spread the love and add realism to the pack.<br>
  * Be aware that some callouts use specific locations in order to have more realistic locations.<br>
    <i>In other words, a bank robbery won't happen at a 24/7 and a disturbance between two people won't be at a police station.</i><br>
  * For ease and to ensure you constantly have a mixture of callouts, all callouts have a location choosing system in order to get the locations near the Player(you).<br><br>

### Customization
* This plugin adds a hotkey for dialogs and for forcing your current callout to end.<br>
  * "Y" for speaking to a suspect. (You'll get a notification when you must talk to a suspect)<br>
  * "END" to force your current callout to end. (In some cases, you may want to end the callout by yourself)<br>
  * You can change both hotkeys in the <code>SWL-Callouts.ini</code> file.<br>

* Option to enable/disable the callouts you want in the <code>SWL-Callouts.ini</code> file (All callouts enabled by default).<br>
  * You may want to use this option to avoid some callouts you don't want to play.<br>

* Option to enable/disable AI backup responding to a callout with the Player(you) in the <code>SWL-Callouts.ini</code> file.<br>
  * This option allows realistic AI units to respond to certain callouts at the same time with the Player(you). This means a local unit won't respond to a gang fight.
    Note: <i>If the Player(you) is in a pursuit, you'll get help by local units and an air unit instead of a SWAT team.</i><br>
  * RECOMMENDED: <u>If you don't have a powerful PC, set this option in the </u><code>SWL-Callouts.ini</code><u> to <code>false</code>.</u><br><br>
  
### Want to stay up to date?
* SWL-Callouts has a version control system to let you know when SWL-Callouts or LSPDFR has been updated.<br>
  * NOTE: You can still play with SWL-Callouts on your own risk. It's always recommended to update to the latest build.<br>
  * SWL-Callouts may have issues when LSPDFR gets an update that change parts of it's API. <u>-- Please notify us if this happens</u><br><br>

## Usage

Once you're in game open the RPH console with F4 <i>(by default)</i> and load LSPDFR with <code>"LoadPlugin LSPD First Response.dll"</code>. 
You can also load LSPDFR on start up <i>(Take a look at the RPH settings for that)</i>.

After LSPDFR is loaded, go on duty and then SWL-Callouts will automatically get loaded and start giving you calls.
You'll now get callouts over time. You can also force callouts with the RPH console by using the command <code>StartCallout [CALLOUT-NAME]</code>.<br><br>
